This code is for the Brain in a Jar project.
 * It uses sample code, mostly from the LCD template written by Mark Bramwell
 * and includes samples from the Fast LED library to control the LED strip,
 * the Relay test code, and The Button Debounce code, all written by other 
 * authors.
 * 
 * This Code is rather simple and my contsain mistakes, redundancies, etc.
 * You are free to use, modify, and distribute this code as long as you 
 * include this portion of the code in your distrubution as well as comply 
 * with the restrictions listed in the code authored by others, who's 
 * samples were used in the creation of this code.
