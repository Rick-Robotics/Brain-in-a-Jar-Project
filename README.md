# Brain-in-a-Jar-Project
This is the code used for the Brain in a Jar project. Most of this is the examples provided by other authors. The composite of all of the code, used for the project, is my combination of the examples. I don't claim to have contributed to the examples and they can be found on other pages, sites, projects, etc. Enjoy!
